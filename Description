In this project, I analyzed employee attrition data to identify key factors contributing to turnover. The analysis involved data cleaning, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and treating outliers to ensure a robust dataset. I then applied various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and others to predict employee attrition. The project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, with a focus on deriving actionable insights to help improve employee retention strategies.
